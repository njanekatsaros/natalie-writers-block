Tips for getting over writers block
---------------------------------

Cut out any distractions and shut your phone off to stay focused. 

Turn your phone on silent and keep it in your pocket, backpack, or an entirely different room. Close your windows if there are any distracting noises coming in from outside, take your writing tools or laptop to a quiet area, and stay off of social media to focus on what youâ€™re doing.
