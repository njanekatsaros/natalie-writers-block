<h3> Put yourself in a mood to write by... </h3>

<h4> Cut out any distractions and shut your phone off to stay focused. </h4>


  Turn your phone on silent and keep it in your pocket, backpack, or an entirely different room. Close your windows if there are any distracting noises coming in from outside, take your writing tools or laptop to a quiet area, and stay off of social media to focus on what youâ€™re doing.
  
  <h4> Write in a different location to give yourself a change of scenery. </h4>
  
  If you normally write in your office, try heading to a local coffee shop or park. If you normally write at a coffee shop or park, try writing at home. Switch up your scenery to put yourself in a new headspace. For some people, getting out of a routine by changing their setting is deeply helpful when it comes to getting in the mood to write.

<h4> Grab a cup of coffee or tea to get in the mood to write. </h4>

Brewing a cup of coffee or tea is a great way to start on a positive note. Either make or buy yourself a cup and sit down with your warm drink to get ready to write. A small boost of caffeine is a great way to get your mind focused and put you in the mood for some composition.
